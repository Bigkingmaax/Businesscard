This is the first pcb i have ever created. I did it with easyeda.com wich was pretty fast and fun! If you are new to PCB design I can only recommend this software. It's so easy to use. I will also order these ones or a newer cooler version from jlcpcb, easyeda's PCB manufacturing service. They have pretty fast delivery times and are very Cheap!
